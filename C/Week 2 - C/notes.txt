'\n' breaks a line in the terminal, else everything will be printed on one line

single characters use '' and anything more uses ""

unlike Javascript, semicolons are required

will not automatically detect when a function comes after it is called. To use functions
that are placed after main code, put the FULL name of the function followed by a semicolon
before the main function

before creating any variable or function you after to type what kind of variable or return value
is expected ie char, int, string...

requires the use of libraries for a LOT of newer features to be implemented

must put void in functions that do not take an argument, and put the type of data (int, char, string)
an argument is if an argument is included

standard to use _ instead of camelCasing

depending on the output type, %i, %s, %li... is followed by a variable name to input a variable into a string ("hello %s", name) (%i", num)

because of how code is processed into binary code for the computer to read, to return a value any larger than 
around 4.5 million you have to use li (long) variable type instead of int (integer)

similarly to the previous note, to return a decimal value you must convert the ints being divided into floats,
and return a float ( (float) x / (float) y), (printf("%f\n", z))

because of the limitations of C and how it works with software, things can get imprecise when using decimal values past a certain point.
to get a little more precision for a few more places, float can be replaced with keyword double, but beyond that a different more modern 
language would be a more precise option
