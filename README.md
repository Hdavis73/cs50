# cs50

This is a repo where I will be uploading work I'm doing while taking harvards CS50 course on edX.com. This repo will consist of a lot of beginner, or learning materials and each subject will 
have a notes, which will just be a txt file with notes on the topic. I'm creating this repo mainly to track my progress in these topics and through the class, so at the end of it all I will be able
to look back on the timeline and see the improvements.
